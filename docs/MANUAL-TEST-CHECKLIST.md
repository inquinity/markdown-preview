# Manual test checklist

What to look at before handing out a build, and how to tell a pass from a
failure. Written for whoever is doing the release check — which is usually one
person with a laptop, not a CI job.

Two things this exists to prevent:

- **A known limitation read as a regression.** Time gets spent re-diagnosing
  something already understood.
- **A regression read as a known limitation.** Worse, and it has already
  happened here: Mermaid did not render in Quick Look for several releases and
  was written off as expected behaviour. It was a bug, and it is fixed — a
  failure there now is a real regression.

Fixtures under `tests/fixtures/` carry their expectations **in the document
itself**, as `EXPECT` / `FAIL IF` notes you read while looking at the rendered
page. This file covers `samples/`, which is upstream's and deliberately left
unannotated so it merges cleanly.

## Before you start

```bash
./scripts/build.sh
SOURCE_APP=build/MDView.app ./scripts/install.sh   # required for Quick Look to register
qlmanage -r && qlmanage -r cache
```

Quick Look will not pick up a new build until the app has been in
`/Applications` and launched once. If Quick Look looks stale, it is stale.

## 1. Security fixtures — read the notes in the files

| File | What it proves |
|---|---|
| `tests/fixtures/security/inline-html.md` | Sanitisation. **Most sections should look empty; that is the pass.** The credential-harvesting section is the one to read carefully: a password field and a Sign in button appearing means stop, do not ship. |
| `tests/fixtures/security/path-traversal.md` | Containment. Every image must be a broken-image placeholder. Any file contents on screen is a document reading files it has no right to. |
| `tests/fixtures/security/remote-beacon.md` | Tracking pixels. Every image broken, page still styled normally. |
| `tests/fixtures/relative-assets/post.md` | The other half: containment must not break *legitimate* relative images. Two must render, two must not. |

Open each in **both** the app window and Quick Look. They resolve assets by
different mechanisms and have failed independently before.

### Proving no request left the machine

Broken images are consistent with the request being blocked *and* with the host
simply not resolving. To confirm the block itself, watch the network while
opening `remote-beacon.md`:

```bash
sudo tcpdump -n -i any 'tcp port 80 or tcp port 443' | grep -i example
```

Nothing should appear. This is the check that actually distinguishes "blocked"
from "failed to connect", and it is worth doing when the CSP changes.

## 2. Upstream samples

| File | Expected | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `samples/full.md` | Everything renders | The broad smoke test |
| `samples/codeblocks.md` | Syntax highlighting, working copy buttons, **Mermaid diagram renders** | Mermaid in Quick Look was broken until 1.0.3. It must render now, in **both** surfaces |
| `samples/mermaid-heavy.md` | Ten diagram types render | Only diagrams near the viewport render at first; the rest fill in as you scroll. **That is the design, not a failure** — rendering is gated on an `IntersectionObserver` |
| `samples/long-footnotes.md` | Footnote links jump both ways | |
| `samples/navigation.md` | In-document links work | |
| `samples/rtl-test.md` | Right-to-left text lays out correctly | |
| `samples/toml-frontmatter.md` | Frontmatter handled, not dumped as body text | |

## 3. Surfaces

Check each sample in the surface it matters for:

- **App window** — the main reader
- **Quick Look** — select the file in Finder, press space. The copy button
  must not overlap the document text (it had no clearance at all before 1.0.3)
- **Print / PDF export** — Mermaid and maths must appear in the output, not
  just on screen
- **Editor** — open, type, save

## 4. Release build

For a `--release` build, verify the artifact rather than trusting the log:

```bash
xcrun stapler validate "dist/MDView <version>.dmg"
spctl -a -vvv -t open --context context:primary-signature "dist/MDView <version>.dmg"
```

Both must pass. Then **check it on a second Mac** — one that has never run this
app and never had the developer certificate. That is the only test of what a
colleague actually experiences, and it has caught problems that every local
check missed.

## Known limitations — not regressions

- **Remote images do not load, anywhere.** Deliberate: it closes the
  tracking-pixel hole. README badges appear broken. Deferred improvement is
  F4, a click-to-load control like a mail client's.
- **No automatic updates.** Sparkle is removed; new builds are handed out by
  hand.
- **The command line tools are gone.** The installer is orphaned and its
  Settings button was removed in 1.0.3.
