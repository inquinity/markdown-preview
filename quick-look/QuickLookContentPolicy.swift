/// The extension holds `com.apple.security.network.client`, and cannot give it
/// up: without it, WKWebView inside a sandboxed app extension never completes
/// its load, `didFinish` never fires, and the preview renders blank. That was
/// verified on this fork by removing the entitlement and watching Quick Look go
/// blank while the extension still launched and `qlmanage` still exited zero.
///
/// The consequence is that a Markdown document referencing a remote image could
/// reach the network when a file is merely spacebar-previewed in Finder — no
/// click, no app launch — telling that server the file was opened. Since the
/// sandbox can no longer prevent it, the page does.
///
/// This is safe to make strict because the Quick Look shell is entirely
/// self-contained. `MarkdownHTML` inlines the vendor bundles as `<script>`
/// blocks rather than referencing them, `InlineLocalAssets` rewrites local
/// images to `data:` URLs (view-controller path) or `cid:` attachments
/// (`QLPreviewReply` path), and the page loads with a nil base URL. Nothing
/// legitimate on this page needs an external origin.
///
/// The main app's preview is a different shape — it serves vendor scripts and
/// images over the `md-asset:` scheme — and is not covered here. See
/// docs/FORK-NOTES.md (F2).
